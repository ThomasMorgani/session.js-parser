        <h3>Phased Reopening</h3>
        <p>
          We continue to plan towards expanding the library services available
          to you. Our top priority, as always, is the health and safety of our
          patrons and staff. We will continue following the rulings and
          recommendations of our local, state and federal leadership throughout
          this process, working alongside health and safety officials and our
          colleagues to safely serve you. Based upon comments from the Governor
          and other officials, it seems that Long Island is close to reaching
          Phase 1 of the statewide reopening plan. However, while we we remain
          closed, please do not return library materials in our book drop, fines
          will <em>not</em> be assessed for overdue materials while the Library
          is closed. Please check this website for continued updates on the
          library&rsquo;s status.
